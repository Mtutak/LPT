        Packages
One-on-One Training: This is where one client and one trainer will meet for about one hour, 2 to 4 times a week depending on their needs.  During this time, we will go through a stretch routine, training, and discuss diet, sleep, stress and any other area of concern.  We will also do a monthly assessment to track progress and reevaluate our direction.

Sport Specific Personal Training: This type of training is also a one hour session where we recommend 1-3x per week depending on the individual's needs. During this time, we will assess and administer exercises that will help the individual improve on the sport specific movements that need the most work. This individualized approach helps the athlete excel by working on specific areas such as: Speed, Power, Acceleration, Deceleration, Flexibility, Balance, Coordination and over all Strength.

Small Group Training: This type of training can be just as effective and is more affordable.  Small groups of 2 to 5 people will meet and go through a stretch routine, and then a group version of the appropriate training.  As with the one-on-one training, a monthly assessment for each member of the group will be completed for motivation and tracking of your success.  This is a great way to spend time with your friends while accomplishing a healthier you.

Maintenance Training: This type of training is for the individual who has already achieved their goals and is now looking to maintain their shape and receive motivation.  For this training, you will meet with a trainer once a week and a self-driven workout will be designed for you.  Also included in this training is a monthly physical assessment to track your progress.

Individualized packages are available based on your need and overall objective.

Pricing is dependent on location and session package.  We accept cash, check, PayPal and all major Credit Cards.

    <p>I hired LPT to lose a little weight. Never did I think I would not only lose the weight, but the muscle definition I have attained is unbelievable. I could never have done this on my own. Not only did LPT help transform my body, but they also gave a wealth of information on nutrition and healthy living and has educated my mind, not just my body. LPT is definitely an investment for your future. I am in the best shape of my life at 34 years old.</p>

    <p>Like many people, I have struggled with my weight my entire life. When I got engaged I was at my highest weight ever and was determined to get into shape before my wedding, but I new I couldn't do it alone.</br> I heard of Lifestyle Personal Training and decided to give them a try. While training, my goals changed from just wanting to lose weight for the wedding to a desire to lead a healthier life overall.</br>The trainers at LPT love what they do and share their knowledge with you so, when you do have to go off on your own, you will be successful.</br> When I started with Lifestyle Personal Training I was wearing a size 14; now I am wearing a size 8! LPT supported me and helped me get into the best shape of my life and I have never felt better.</p>

    <p>Lifestyle Personal Training has changed my life. I'm diabetic, have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. From working out with LPT, I have cut my blood pressure medication in half, I have cut my blood sugar medication from 1,000mg a day to 250mg and have eliminated one of the two medications I take for cholesterol.</br>When walking into work from my car, I would have to walk so slow because I would run out of breath. Now I walk 2 miles everyday on my lunch break. I have also participated in a 4 mile walk for charity.</br>LPT is not only there for the exercise, but also they're there for emotional support and guidance. Their commitment to me brings out the fight and commitment within myself.</br>I've struggled all my life with my weight. Dieting on and off, and maybe exercising. Not really understanding what a difference a proper workout can make. It does make a difference.... I believe it saved my life.</p>

    <p>I have one word to describe personal training with Lifestyle Personal Training…Phenomenal!!!  I was probably the biggest skeptic around about exercise & the benefits of exercise & proper nutrition before I started working out with LPT. </br> Summer hit, and I decided I was sick of eating bad, and, quite frankly, looking completely out of shape.  LPT trainers are excellent motivators.  I was hitting a Size 8 or 10 prior to training with them.  In just two and a half months I have dropped down to a Size 2. </br>I have never felt better BOTH physically and mentally since I started training with LPT.  I’m no longer sluggish, my focus/concentration at work is now phenomenal, and I look great!  Also, I now actually look forward to working out!!!  Additionally, an added bonus is that LPT is really knowledgeable about exercise & nutrition…They definitely know their stuff!!!  Take it from a true exercise skeptic…LPT has converted me into an exercise worshipper!!!  I highly, highly recommend Lifestyle Personal Training!!!</p>

    <p>After having two kids and struggling with my weight for 9 years, I thought enough was enough. I was finally ready to be committed to losing weight. I knew I would need a little help, but a little is not what LPT gave me. They gave me a whole lot more: a ton of motivation, education on what to eat, and how to transform my whole personal appearance. They have so much knowledge in this field that I learned something new every time we worked out.</br>Being a hair dresser, I think it's awesome when my clients ask me for advice on how to lose weight and eat healthy. I actually feel great after working out and guilty if I don't.</br>I have never felt this healthy in my whole life. I can finally say I really love to go shopping!</p>

I set a course to get back to the basics of weight loss, more exercise, better nutrition, and fewer empty calories Lifestyle Personal Training helped me with a positive attitude.
